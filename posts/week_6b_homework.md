## Reflection: What I Took from Information & Thinking by Michel Serres

Michel Serres‚Äô Information & Thinking gave me new ideas for my chaos-themed p5.js work.

**1. ‚ÄúWhat is thinking, if not at least carrying out these four operations: receiving, emitting, storing and processing information like all existing things?‚Äù**

This sentence helped me see thinking as something shared by everything, not just humans. Every cell, plant, or pixel also does this. In my sketch, each grid cell does a simple form of thinking. It stores data and reacts when clicked or glitched. Together, the whole grid becomes a system that thinks.


**2. ‚ÄúThe information that I am speaking of, instead, is closer to a rarity... and it constitutes the bedrock of thinking.‚Äù**

Serres says information is not something common. It is rare. These rare things come from disorder. I might use noise to create random, rare patterns in the grid. When glitch happens, it creates a short moment of visual surprise.

**3.‚ÄúInversely, thinking means inventing: getting hold of rarity, discovering the secret of that which has the huge and contingent chance to exist or to be born tomorrow.‚Äù**

This line links chaos to imagination. My code will use randomness to create new shapes. These shapes are always changing.It tries to make space for something new to appear.

**Technology choice**

recursion / glitch Ôºàmight choose more laterÔºâ

**Rough draft**

<script type="module">

const iframes = document.querySelectorAll('.p5js_canvas');

if (iframes.length > 0) {
    iframes.forEach((iframe) => {
        iframe.width  = iframe.parentNode.scrollWidth;
        iframe.height = iframe.width * 9 / 16 + 42;
    });

Today I built the base grid‚Äîclicking cells toggles them black/empty. It‚Äôs simple now, but this will let users ‚Äòdraw‚Äô into the system before I add noise and glitches.

1.Grid Structure 2D array

It's a simple way to track cell states `(true/false = filled/empty)`
Easy to scale (cols/rows adjust to canvas size)

Used black fill `(fill(0))` for "on" cells
Kept no fill + gray border `(noFill(), stroke(180))` for "off" cells

2. Click Interaction

Calculated cell index using `floor(mouseX / cellWidth)`

Added boundary checks to avoid errors `(if (i >= 0 && i < cols))`

Designed it to support future modes (later added play/pause)


**What I Planned to Add Next**

Dynamic Grid: Replace fixed cell sizes with noise-driven widths

Let the grid "breathe" over time (`t += speedSlider.value()`).



Core Coding Techniques
This work demonstrates several foundational programming concepts in creative, layered ways:

‚úÖ Variables

Used extensively to store system state (e.g. playing, t, contrast, glitchCells, lastLevel). Variables like glitchStart and glitchDuration are critical for managing timed visual effects.

üîÅ Iteration

Nested for loops control grid layout and animation. They are used to traverse both rows and columns for rendering (draw()) and for checking states like flashing or glitching cells.

üß† Functions

Modular logic is handled through functions like spreadGlitch(i, j, depth) for recursive glitch effects, mousePressed() for user interaction, and draw() as the core animation loop.

üîò Boolean Logic

Boolean values (e.g. playing, glitchActive, grid[i][j]) are used to determine whether to fill a cell, trigger sound, or activate visuals. Conditionals like if (level - lastLevel > 0.1) handle beat detection based on amplitude spikes.

üì¶ Arrays

2D arrays (grid[][], beatFlash[][]) store the state of each cell. Arrays are also used for column/row sizes (colWidths, rowHeights) and for sound samples (samples[]).

üß± Classes

While no custom classes are explicitly defined in this version, the system leverages object-like structures (e.g. {i, j} cell objects in glitchCells) and p5.js built-in class instances like p5.SoundFile, p5.Amplitude, and p5.Delay.

üîÅ Recursion

The spreadGlitch() function uses recursion to propagate a visual explosion across neighboring cells. It spreads the glitch effect in expanding waves, mimicking organic or chaotic diffusion.
